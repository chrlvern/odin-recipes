    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Margarine</li>
        <li>White Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Bread Crumbs</li>
        <li>Bacon Bits</li>
        <li>Chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. <br> Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. <br> Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. <br> Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
        <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. <br> Top with chives and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
